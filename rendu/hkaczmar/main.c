** Will a simple binary search tree outrun the hashtables some students already
** turned in? We'll have to see :)
**
** I didn't want to use a hashtable because of collisions and the big memory
** footprint it entails. Given that the subject doesn't give clear boundaries on how
** long a key is allowed to be, or how big the sample size will be at a maximum, I
** believe it would be very hard to provide a working solution with a simple
** hash table.
**
** It is true, double hashing is a thing, but I'm more interested to see if a
** simple binary search tree can perform well in this challenge.
